Alright people, now that we have gone through all the basic fundamentals of Python.
We are now going to create a simple project with Python.

Project Name: Tic Tac Toe Game
Functionality:

-	2 Players should be able to play the game (Both sitting at the same computer)
-	The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move
-	You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place symbol on the board.
-	We will use the numpad to match numbers to the grid on a tic tac toe board:

 

-	First user will select the number where he wants to place the number and then select the symbol either X or O
- 	After that a loop will run accepting user input until a player wins
